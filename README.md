### Example Generated Email

```
Subject: OpenAI's Sales Growth: An AI Edge?

Hi there,

Huge congratulations on the GPT-5 launch and your expanded Microsoft partnership! 
OpenAI's leadership in enterprise AI, leveraging technologies like GPT-5 and Azure, 
is truly groundbreaking.

Given your pioneering work in *building* such advanced AI, I thought of Analytos.ai. 
We help B2B companies apply AI to *optimize their sales processes*, translating 
powerful models into consistent revenue growth.

I'd love to briefly share how we enable sales teams to achieve efficiency gains, 
much like OpenAI achieves AI breakthroughs. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute 
chat next week?

P.S. Hey Lade Sai Teja! 👋
This is Sai Teja testing an AI-powered lead generation system I built for 
Analytos.ai assessment. You're one of my test subjects! 😄
The email above was 100% generated by Google Gemini AI based on your company's 
recent news. Pretty cool, right?

Let me know what you think! (And sorry for the spam! 😅)

- Sai Teja, SASTRA University

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding a New Agent

```python
from agents.base_agent import BaseAgent

class MyNewAgent(BaseAgent):
    def execute(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        self.log_execution_start(inputs)
        
        # Your logic here
        result = {"key": "value"}
        
        self.log_execution_end(result, success=True)
        return self.format_output(result)
```

### Extending Workflow

1. Add agent to `workflow.json`
2. Implement agent class in `agents/`
3. Run `python langgraph_builder.py`
