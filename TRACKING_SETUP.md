# 🚀 Real-Time Email Tracking Setup Guide

## What We Just Built:

✅ Flask webhook server running on http://localhost:5000
✅ Live dashboard at http://localhost:5000/
✅ API endpoint for stats at http://localhost:5000/stats
✅ SendGrid webhook endpoint at http://localhost:5000/webhook/sendgrid

## Next Steps to Enable Real-Time Tracking:

### Option 1: Use ngrok (Recommended for Testing)

1. **Download ngrok**: https://ngrok.com/download
2. **Extract and run**:
   ```powershell
   ngrok http 5000
   ```
3. **Copy the HTTPS URL** (looks like: https://abc123.ngrok.io)
4. **Configure SendGrid Webhook**:
   - Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/mail_settings
   - Click "Event Webhook" → "EDIT"
   - **Enable Event Webhook**: ON
   - **HTTP Post URL**: `https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok.io/webhook/sendgrid`
   - **Select Events**:
     ☑️ Delivered
     ☑️ Opened
     ☑️ Clicked
     ☑️ Bounced
     ☑️ Spam Report
   - **Save**
   - **Test Your Integration** button

5. **Watch Events Come In!**
   - Open http://localhost:5000/ in your browser
   - You'll see real-time events as your friends open/click emails!

### Option 2: Deploy to Cloud (For Production)

#### Deploy to Railway (FREE):
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

#### Deploy to Render (FREE):
1. Go to https://render.com/
2. Connect GitHub repo
3. Create new "Web Service"
4. Use: `python webhook_server.py`

### Option 3: Use SendGrid's Signed Events (Most Secure)

Add signature verification to webhook_server.py:
```python
from sendgrid.helpers.eventwebhook import EventWebhook, EventWebhookHeader

@app.route('/webhook/sendgrid', methods=['POST'])
def sendgrid_webhook():
    # Get signature from headers
    signature = request.headers.get(EventWebhookHeader.SIGNATURE)
    timestamp = request.headers.get(EventWebhookHeader.TIMESTAMP)
    
    # Verify signature
    event_webhook = EventWebhook()
    public_key = os.getenv('SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEY')
    
    if not event_webhook.verify_signature(
        request.data, signature, timestamp, public_key
    ):
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid signature"}), 403
    
    # Continue with event processing...
```

## Current Status:

✅ Webhook server is RUNNING
✅ Dashboard is LIVE at http://localhost:5000/
⏳ Waiting for ngrok setup to expose to internet
⏳ Waiting for SendGrid webhook configuration

## What You'll See:

When friends open your emails:
```
📊 Tracked event: open for shanmugapriya@gmail.com
👀 EMAIL OPENED by shanmugapriya@gmail.com!
```

When they click links:
```
📊 Tracked event: click for kumar@sastra.ac.in
🖱️ LINK CLICKED by kumar@sastra.ac.in: https://analytos.ai
```

## Dashboard Features:

📬 **Delivered Count** - How many emails were successfully delivered
👀 **Unique Opens** - How many different people opened
🖱️ **Total Clicks** - All clicks on links
⚠️ **Bounces** - Failed deliveries

Plus live event feed showing every action in real-time!
